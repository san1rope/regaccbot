# regaccbot
Bot for registering accounts. 
Connects to the database, adds a new user or changes his password. 
I use Python and PostgreSQL via gino. 
In the .env file you need to substitute your data and remove the prefix in the file name - '.dist'. 
The bot is written based on the template - https://github.com/Latand/tgbot_template.
